# Transfer Signature

This project is cloned from the [Alchemy Github ECDSA Node project](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/ecdsa-node) and has been completed with the following improvements:

- Added empty message signature as authentication in the client and server requests.
- Added Keccak address generation and retrieval in the client.
- Added clarity improvements and success and failure messages.

### Client

The client folder contains a [react app](https://reactjs.org/) using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To get started, follow these steps:

1. Open up a terminal in the `/client` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application
4. Now you should be able to visit the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173/

### Server

The server folder contains a node.js server using [express](https://expressjs.com/). To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal within the `/server` folder
2. Run `npm install` to install all the depedencies
3. Run `node index` to start the server

The application should connect to the default server port (3042) automatically!

_Hint_ - Use [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) instead of `node` to automatically restart the server on any changes.
