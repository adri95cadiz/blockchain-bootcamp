The first weekly project is in branch [ECDSA-Node](https://github.com/adri95cadiz/blockchain-bootcamp/tree/ECDSA-Node), and contains the first project, cloned from the [Alchemy Github ECDSA Node project](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/ecdsa-node), completed with the following improvements:

- Added empty message signature as authentication in the client and server requests.

- Added clarity improvements and success and failure messages.
